The purpose of the tracker is to track the success of this site and to compare its performance to the overall market. To do this, I started with $10,000 the first week the site went live and update the balance every week based upon the closing price of the RSP which is an equal-weight S&P 500 ETF.

When a signal is triggered, we assume that the buy or sell happens at the closing price of the market that week. On a buy, the shares held are calculated by dividing the balance by the closing price of the RSP. On a sell the cash is determined by the number of shares times the closing price of the RSP. It is meant to show what would happen if you had bought (or sold) the RSP ETF when the site gave the signal since the site launched.

This is not real money that I am investing although I do follow the indicators on the site. The purpose of the tracker is to give an unbiased account of how the site is fairing at managing a portfolio over a period of time.
