<h4>The trend of the stock market is <b>up.</b></h4>

<h4>The yield curve is <b>inverted.<sup>*</sup></b></h4>

<h4>
  The valuation of the stock market is <b>normal.</b>
</h4>

<h4>
  Sentiment in the stock market is <b>bearish.</b>
</h4>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">The current state of the stock market is <b>neutral.</b> It doesn't matter whether you are in or out of the market.</h2>

<sub>*This inversion is not particularly bearish at this point because the inversion resulted as much from long yields falling as from short yields rising (see section on yields for more info on this). This would be negated if the short end continued to climb well past the long end. The curve was also not majorly inverted. I prefer to keep this simple and consistent by just basing the reading on whether it was inverted or not at the close of the week, but this indicator always requires a closer inspection.</sub>
