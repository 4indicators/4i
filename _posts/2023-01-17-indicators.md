<h4>The trend of the stock market is <b>up.</b></h4>

<h4>The yield curve is <b>inverted.</b></h4>

<h4>
  The valuation of the stock market is <b>expensive.</b>
</h4>

<h4>
  Sentiment in the stock market is <b>neutral.</b>
</h4>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">The current state of the stock market is <b>neutral.</b> It doesn't matter whether you are in or out of the market.</h2>

<b>Subtext:</b> The prevailing trend is always the most important thing. While most indicators are pointing bearish, trend is bullish so this equates to a neutral reading to me. Trend is carrying a lot of weight here, though.
